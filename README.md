# Demoz Mobile App

So I built Demoz Mobile App, which follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern to keep things organized and efficient. The app is designed to be friendly and accessible, with support for two languages to cater to a diverse audience.

## External Libraries,

- GetX : This was my go-to for state management, routing, and dependency injection. 
- get_storage : I used this to store datas in local storage.
- flutter_localization: I used this to change languages with built-in localization support.
- file_picker: I used this to allow users select files directly from their devices.
- page_transition: I used this to create smooth transitions between screens to keep user experience.
- flutter_screenutil: I used this so that the app’s UI to different screen sizes so everything looks great on any device.
- fl_chart: I used it to create customizable charts for displaying data.
- flutter_launcher_icons: I used this to update the app’s icon to match its style.

## Multilingual Support
